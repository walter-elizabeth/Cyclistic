# Cyclistic
Case Study for the Google Data Analytics Certificate

The project involves a fictional bike-sharing company, Cyclistic, where you're (I'm) a Junior Data Analyst on the Marketing Analytics Team. The Director of Marketing wants to maximize the number of annual memberships by converting casual riders. The analyst is tasked with finding out how casual riders and member riders use the bikes differently. The insights I report will be used to design marketing strategies towards the goal of converting causal riders. You are given the data in Excel sheets of monthly rides for your analysis.

Ultimately, you are responsible for 5 deliverables: 
1. A clear statement of the business task
2. A description of all the data sources used
3. Documentation of any cleaning or manipulation of data
4. A summary of your analysis
5. Supporting visualizations and key findings

which you will present in your choice of format. I have chosen to include the 5 deliverables in one PowerPoint presentation (available in this repository), which includes links to the Excel and SQL documentation found in this repositiory and to the [Tableau dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/elizabeth.a.walter/viz/Cyclistic_17442458867340/Dashboard1) of these figures.
