In Excel, the following actions were performed for each of the 12 excel sheets:

1. Filter to get a look of the data. 
2. Add a row called day_of_week, using started_at column, where 1 = Sunday, 2 = Monday, etc. 
3. Added a row called ride_length by subtracting ended_at column from started_at column.
4. Ride length was validated with conditional formatting using day_of_week and temp column day_of_week_end, where if day_of_week != day_of_week_end, ride_length was checked to be over 24 hrs
5. Ride length was properly formatted to account for rides that lasted over several days that were not being properly added up by the default formatting.

In SQL, the following queries were run to clean and manipulate the data:

After loading the data, the tables were combined. There was an issue with inconsistent data types that had to be fixed before all 12 tables could be joined.
